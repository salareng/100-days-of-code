# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 1, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: I was able to setup the JS structure of the project. Updated JSON and the theme layout.  

**Thoughts:** I really struggled on setting up the JS structure and the JSON call. It's been a long time since I touched it after all. The floats were a challenge for a time but nothing that clear does not fix.
